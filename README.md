# Explore the Red Planet: Mars Data Analysis Project 🚀

Welcome, space enthusiasts! This project is a cosmic journey to scrape and analyze data about our enigmatic neighbor, Mars. With a blend of web scraping and data analysis, we're going to uncover the secrets held in Mars news articles and weather data. Whether you're a seasoned data scientist or a curious newbie, this expedition is for anyone fascinated by the mysteries of the cosmos.

## 🌌 Project Deliverables

- **Deliverable 1:** Unravel the latest Mars news by scraping article titles and previews.
- **Deliverable 2:** Decode the Martian climate by scraping and analyzing weather data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before we launch, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook for your mission control interface
- Libraries: Beautiful Soup for web scraping, Pandas for data wrangling, Splinter for automating your spacecraft (browser)

### Mission Files

Grab your space gear [here](#) (Module 11 Challenge files) to start your journey. These include the mission blueprints (starter code) for both parts of the project.

## 📡 Mission Instructions

### Part 1: Mars News Exploration

1. Open the mission blueprint `part_1_mars_news.ipynb`.
2. Use Splinter to land on the Mars news site. Inspect the terrain (page) to identify elements to scrape.
3. Deploy Beautiful Soup to extract textual signals.
4. Collect titles and previews of news articles, storing each in a dictionary (`title` and `preview`). Gather these in a list for analysis.
5. *(Optional)* Share your findings by exporting the scraped data to a JSON file.

### Part 2: Martian Climate Analysis

1. Proceed to `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`.
2. Navigate to the Mars Temperature Data Site. Use Beautiful Soup to mine the data from the HTML table.
3. Transform the data into a Pandas DataFrame, ensuring correct column headings.
4. Analyze the Martian atmosphere and temperature, answering the mysteries of Martian weather.
5. Document your findings by exporting the DataFrame to a CSV file.

## 🌠 Cosmic Queries

Embark on a quest to answer these stellar questions:
- How many Martian months exist?
- What's the tally of Martian days' worth of data we've collected?
- Identify the extremes of Martian climate: the coldest and warmest months.
- Determine the months with the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure.
- Estimate the length of a Martian year in terrestrial days.

## 🛠 Mission Requirements

### Part 1

- Navigate the Mars news site using automated browsing and extract insights with Beautiful Soup.
- Catalog the information in a list of dictionaries for easy data transmission.

### Part 2

- Decode the HTML table into a well-structured Pandas DataFrame.
- Conduct a thorough analysis of Martian weather, supported by visual data.
- Archive the findings in a CSV file for future explorers.
